# Sigma-to
Sigma-to project refers to converting sigma rules to something which we use in enterprise environment.

Sigma is Generic Signature Format for SIEM Systems written by Florian Roth @Neo23x0 and Thomas Patzke. All the sigma rules are available at:- https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma 

Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straight forward manner. 
Sigma is for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is for files.

This repository contains: 
Organized and simplified spreadsheet containing all the sigma rules and their conversion/translation to various SIEM vendors.
Vendors such as Splunk, Qradar, Arcsight and Elasticsearch are included. The spreadsheet contains search queries compatible with respective SIEM vendors.
